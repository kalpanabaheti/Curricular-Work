Since a lot of my graduate studies homework was on worksheets given by the university with a control on email sharing, I am sharing what I can on this private repository. 
I've already uploaded function encoding for mixture models and bayesian statistics and OR assignments, I'll upload the rest of the AI course material, which includes - search algorithms, gameplay AI, decision trees, and bayesian networks.
