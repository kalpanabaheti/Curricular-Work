Since a lot of my graduate studies homework was on worksheets given by the university with a control on email sharing, I am sharing what I can on this private repository. I've already uploaded function encoding for mixture models and bayesian statistics. 

I'll upload the OR assignments and the rest of the AI course material, which includes - 

1. search algorithms
2. gameplay AI
3. decision trees
4. bayesian networks.
